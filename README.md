Simon Game that randomly choses a colour pattern for the player to choose on screen, and increases the length of the pattern with the increasing level. The difficulty keeps on increasing, the hoghest I could reach was Level 19. Resets after wrong pattern is chosen by the player. Made using JavaScript + HTML + CSS.
